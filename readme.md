# File Janitor
This is a small WinForm app that allows a user to specifiy a desired folder and desired file extension and either recycle or delete all files matching the specified extension in the folder.

This is inspired by a Python script for Windows systems that I previously created that would do a similar thing, although this has a UI so that it is user configurable so that the source code does not need to be changed to change the target folder and file extension.
